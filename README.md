# A MultiModal Cross-Platform Personality Analysis System with Deception-Detection

This project proposes the development of a Personality Prediction System Using Social Media Posts and Stories, which leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to automatically analyze a user’s online content and predict their personality traits based on the Big Five Personality Traits model — Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN).
By analyzing language patterns, sentiment, tone, and recurring themes in textual and visual content from platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter, the system will infer personality characteristics with a high degree of accuracy. This automated approach reduces human bias and offers scalable personality insights that can benefit areas such as human resource management, mental health assessment, targeted advertising, and user personalization.
The implementation will involve data scraping APIs (for publicly available content), text and image preprocessing, NLP techniques (such as tokenization, sentiment analysis, and embedding), and the training of predictive models using supervised learning algorithms. Technologies such as Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and spaCy will be utilized for development.
This system presents an innovative and ethical approach to understanding personality through data already being generated, with user privacy and consent as primary considerations. It represents a step forward in integrating artificial intelligence with psychology and social media analytics for meaningful, real-world applications.
